# Aamid Mohsin's Online Portfolio

The aim of this project is to demonstrate my skills working with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Bootstrap was used in the development.

This is version 1.0 of my personal portfolio site. More content has yet to be added, and is not complete at this point.

The site has a resposnsive web design suitable for all device screen sizes on a modern web browser.
